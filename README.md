# Redux Student Feedback Form

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Project_

This is a snippet application meant to collect student feedback at the end of every class. It allows students to rate their dayly level of how supported they were, how well they understood the concepts, how they felt about the class, and also to add any additional comments before reviewing and submitting their feedback.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`,
2. Run the queries in the `init.sql` file to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly.
   The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal

## Built With

- React.js
