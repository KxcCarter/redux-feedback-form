# Kenneth Carter Redux Feedbck Loop

## Description

Base mode is complete and can be viewed at localhost:3000/#/1
I am working on implementing a Material-UI stepper component, which is rendered on the root route. Currently it does not communicate with the Redux store.

### TODO:

[x] Currently inputs are range inputs, and they are set to a default value of 5, meaning I can't use the 'required' attribute on them because it looks like they have already had user interaction.
[x] Use radio buttons instead.
[ ] Add Material-UI
